Identity: fraction of bases that are shared between the genome and your sequencing reads. Sequencing errors and gaps in coverage will reduce the identity estimate.

Shared hashes: For each kmer in the dataset screened a “hash” is created and compared with the kmers or “hashes” in each genome present in the databases. When all kmers are shared with a particular genome than 1000/1000 is the value for shared hashes.

Median multiplicity: This is a “rough estimate” for abundance, but it is effected by the size of the reference genome, small genomes tend to produce large values, while having low identity and few shared hashes.

P-value: the probability of observing the number of shared k-mers with the estinated identity

Query-ID: accession number of the reference

Query-comment: Name of the reference
